    When women suffer from vaginal dryness, they often have other issues, such as feminine odor and painful sex. The
    NeuEve suppository is by far the only available womenâ€™s personal hygiene product that can provide multiple functions
    as:

    <em>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Deodorant
            </li>
            <li>
                Cleanser (dry-cleanser as opposed to douche)
            </li>
            <li>
                Moisturizer
            </li>
            <li>
                Lubricant
            </li>
        </ul>
    </em>

<p>
    Application of NeuEve can simultaneously alleviate feminine odor, vaginal dryness, and sexual pain. Unlike other
    deodorants, cleansers, moisturizers, and lubricants, the NeuEve patented formula contains all natural and green
    (food-grade) ingredients. It does not contain any potentially harmful synthetic, artificial, or petroleum-derived
    chemical additives or preservatives.
