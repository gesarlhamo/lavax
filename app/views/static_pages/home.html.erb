<p>"This suppository is fantastic! I have had all the symptoms of menopause: dry, odor and sexual pain. I have not had
sex with my husband for years. Doctor prescribed vaginal estrogen suppositories, but they did not work for me. I
used only 3 NeuEve’s suppositories and all my issues are gone. I feel great and can enjoy sex again. It has really
saved my marriage."<p>

weekend. I need to receive some more ASAP."<p>
