The following is feedback we have received from satisfied customers:
<br>
<br>
"Since entering menopause, I have had vaginal dryness, and could not get close to my husband. This product is super.
With only one application, all my issues are gone. I feel like a young woman again. My husband is happy too."
<br>
<br>
“I have had this awful smell for many years and tried everything possible but nothing worked, not even prescription
drugs. This product really works."
<br>
<br>
“This thing works. The bad odor is gone and I feel really good. I plan to take a vacation with my husband to Florida
next week. I am going to have some fun. Please send me more ASAP."
<br>
<br>
"This suppository is fantastic! I have had all the symptoms of menopause: dry, odor and sexual pain. I have not had
sex with my husband for years. Doctor prescribed vaginal estrogen suppositories, but they did not work for me. I
used only 3 NeuEve’s suppositories and all my issues are gone. I feel great and can enjoy sex again. It has really
saved my marriage."
<br>
<br>
"NeuEve is fantastic! It works better than other lubricants and lasts much longer. Sex is wonderful again."
<br>
<br>
“Could you send me more of the NeuEve suppositories? I have used up my last one. My husband will visit me this
weekend. I need to receive some more ASAP."
<br>
<br>
"Thank you! This product not only helps relieve dryness but also boosts sexual satisfaction. My husband and I both
like it very much. He said that this thing is better than Viagra. Please send me more."
