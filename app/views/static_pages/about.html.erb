<h3>Our Company</h3>
<p>
  Lavax, Inc. is an Illinois-based research, development, manufacturer and distributor of all-natural,
  environmentally-friendly personal health care products. We are a small, family-owned company, established nearly 14
  years ago in Palatine, IL. Our goal is to utilize cutting edge science and technology to develop innovative health
  care products to improve human lives. To date, our research projects have won two Small Business Innovation Research
  grants from National Institutes of Health and two Grand Challenge Exploration grants from Bill & Melinda Gates
  Foundation.
<p>
  All of our all-natural products have been developed by our team of scientists. We test our products on ourselves, we
  wouldn't be selling them to the market if we weren't extremely satisfied with the results. All the formulas have been
  thoroughly tested and found to deliver immediate and powerful results, time after time.
<h3>Our Team <br></h3>

<h4>Renjie Chang, M.D., M.S., Founder & President</h4>
<p>
  Dr. Chang started the company in 1999, determined to apply the knowledge and skills she had learned from a long
  career in the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology and in the pharmaceutical industry. In the past three decades, she
  worked as an OB-GYN in the Peking Union Hospital in China, a faculty member of OB-GYN at University of Oklahoma
  Health Sciences Center, and a drug developer at the Abbott Laboratories in Chicago. She established Lavax, Inc. to
  develop an innovative vaginal microbicide for preventing sexually transmitted disease with grants from NIH and Gates
  Foundation. While developing the sophisticated drug, she invented the all-natural NeuEve suppository as a spin-off.
  This innovative technology has made conceptual breakthrough in womenâ€™s personal care. A patent has filed to protect
  its composition of natural ingredients. Because this product is a cosmetic for personal care, not a drug, it can be
  marketed to benefit consumers much sooner.
